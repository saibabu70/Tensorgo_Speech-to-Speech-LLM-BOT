#Speech-to-Speech-LLM-BOT

This project is a speech-to-speech bot that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) technology to process spoken input and generate spoken responses. The bot is designed to assist users by providing intelligent and contextually appropriate responses to their queries, all through a seamless voice-based interaction.

##Key Features
1.Speech Recognition: Captures and converts spoken input into text using Googleâ€™s speech recognition API.
2.LLM Integration: Utilizes the Gemini 1.5 LLM to generate insightful, contextually relevant responses.
3.Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts the LLM-generated text back into speech using pyttsx3, creating a fully voice-based interaction.
4.Interactive GUI: A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter for easy interaction with the bot.

##Installation
1.pip install tkinter
2.pip install SpeechRecognition

##Components
1.Tkinter GUI: Provides the main interface for interaction.
2.SpeechRecognition: Handles the conversion of speech to text.
3.Generative AI: Processes the text input and generates a response.
4.Pyttsx3: Converts the generated text back into speech.
